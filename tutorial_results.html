<!--  Done in terms of GENERIC Science. Assumes equal distribution of each type in system.
 * Doesn't mean improvement in science score, just in time to research (so one low aera will skew results)
 * i.e. 1000 phy 1000 soc and 30 eng would only require 2 systems to break even. This makes your average research
 * slower but since the algorithm assumes that each tech costs the same amount and a third of the science gained
 * is of each type, gaining .66 society would drastically improve average research time. However if none of the
 * science that you would gain is society, it isn't worth taking.

    <h2>Minimum System Science</h2>

      Minimum System Science is the approximate amount of science that a system needs to break even with its tech penalty.
      <br><br>
      <b>Notes</b>
      <lu>
        <li>Minimum System Science assumes that the system has an equivalent amount of each type of science. i.e. 1/3 is physics, 1/3 society and 1/3 engineering.</li>
        <li>The minimum is chosen based on the combined research rate. You can use "Add a System" to get an idea of the minimum science necessary for each category.</li>

    <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      <lu>
        <li>Some tiny bug I'm not willing to spend time finding (likely a minor rounding or type error) occationally colors the combined research rate gain value red or green incorrectly. Only seems to happen with very small values (i.e. +/- 0.1) which is why I don't care enough to deal with it.</li>
