<!--  Done in terms of GENERIC Science. Assumes equal distribution of each type in system.
 * Doesn't mean improvement in science score, just in time to research (so one low aera will skew results)
 * i.e. 1000 phy 1000 soc and 30 eng would only require 2 systems to break even. This makes your average research
 * slower but since the algorithm assumes that each tech costs the same amount and a third of the science gained
 * is of each type, gaining .66 society would drastically improve average research time. However if none of the
 * science that you would gain is society, it isn't worth taking.

    <h2>Minimum System Science</h2>
    <p>

      <img class="smallImg" src="img/minSysSci.png" alt="Average System Science">

      Minimum System Science is the approximate amount of science that a system needs to break even with its tech penalty.
      <br><br>
      <b>Notes</b>
      <lu>
        <li class="longText">Minimum System Science assumes that the system has an equivalent amount of each type of science. i.e. 1/3 is physics, 1/3 society and 1/3 engineering.</li>
        <li class="longText">The minimum is chosen based on the combined research rate. You can use "Add a System" to get an idea of the minimum science necessary for each category.</li>

    <h2>Science Rates</h2>
    <p>

      <img class="smallImg" src="img/researchRates.png" alt="Average System Science">

      This number is the actual value of your science weighted against your empire's tech penalties.

      <br><br>
      <b>Notes</b>
      <lu>
        <li class="longText">The number next to Research Rate is the combined research rate for all technologies. It could be thought of as the average reserach rate. An increase in this number means that the average rate is improved (even if some specific rates might decrease).</li>
        <li class="longText">This number should be used as a precise comparitive tool. For instance, if your empire's physics rate is twice that of another empire's physics rate, it means that you will research physics technologies exactly twice as quickly as they do.</li>
        <li class="longText">I've mostly found it useful as a measure of my own progress between different games because I now know exactly how good my research is relative to previous runs.</li>

    <h2>Tier 5 Research Times</h2>
    <p>

      <img class="smallImg" src="img/researchTimes.png" alt="Average System Science">

      How long it would take to research the tier 5 technologies at the current research rate. Tier 5 technologies are mostly repeatables and a few rare techs like Gateway Construction and Mega-Engineering.

      <br><br>
      <b>Notes</b>
      <lu>
        <li>Increases and decreases in direct proportion to Research Rate.</li>
        <li class="longText">I added this because I thought a clearer visualization/obviously applicable example of the Science Rate values might be helpful to players. Mathematically they may as well be the same number. </li>

    <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      <lu>
        <li>Some tiny bug I'm not willing to spend time finding (likely a minor rounding or type error) occationally colors the combined research rate gain value red or green incorrectly. Only seems to happen with very small values (i.e. +/- 0.1) which is why I don't care enough to deal with it.</li>
