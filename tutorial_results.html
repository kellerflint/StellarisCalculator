<!--  Done in terms of GENERIC Science. Assumes equal distribution of each type in system.
 * Doesn't mean improvement in science score, just in time to research (so one low aera will skew results)
 * i.e. 1000 phy 1000 soc and 30 eng would only require 2 systems to break even. This makes your average research
 * slower but since the algorithm assumes that each tech costs the same amount and a third of the science gained
 * is of each type, gaining .66 society would drastically improve average research time. However if none of the
 * science that you would gain is society, it isn't worth taking.
